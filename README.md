## Water_plan-T_Mobile_App

## General info
After writing  my Web app using Python, I decided my next project will be a mobile app! I challenged myself to a 7-day-challenge, to learn from scratch and code a running useful android app! This was an amazing experience, got to learn so much and also was surprised how much I enjoyed it!

## App Use
* Keeps a personal log of your plants 
* Pushes notifications to check the moisture of your plants soil, in order to water them only when needed
* Makes taking care of plants much easier!

## Project creation:
* java version: 11
* android studio
* 7 day challenge- summer vacation self project
